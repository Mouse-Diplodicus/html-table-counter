# html-table-counter (WIP)
A short script to count the number of Tables in an htm/html file as well as provide information on the row and column count for each.

Be aware that since the source HTML files I was creating this for were well formatted, with no duplicate tags on the same line, I took some shortcuts
with the code. This program will fail to properly count the tags if there are multiple tags of the same type on the same line.

v0.0.1
